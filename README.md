# solidity_training
BTTC solidity training inspired by Patrick Collins's Solidity & Blockchain trainings

FundMe contract allows us to:
- Get funding from users.
- Withdraw only to contract creator.
- Stores funders vs address list.
- Uses Band protocol smartcontract to get latest BTT price and get minimum amount of BTT to be funded.

If you decide to use the code feel free to use it. However there is no guarantee the code is free of bugs neither it has gone trough a security audit. Use at your own risk.
